However, Windows 10 does not support the A2DP sink role by default. This means you cannot receive audio from other Bluetooth devices via A2DP unless you enable it manually. In this article, we will show you how to enable and use Bluetooth A2DP Sink Device Driver on Windows 10 with some simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Pair your Bluetooth audio source device
 
The first step is to pair your Bluetooth audio source device with your Windows 10 PC. To do this, follow these steps:
 
- On your Windows 10 PC, go to Settings > Devices > Bluetooth & other devices.

- On your Bluetooth audio source device, make sure Bluetooth is turned on and set it to discoverable mode.
- Select your device from the list of available devices on your PC and follow the on-screen instructions to pair them.
- You should see a message that says Your device is ready to go when the pairing is successful.

## Step 2: Install Bluetooth Audio Receiver app
 
The next step is to install a third-party app that can enable the A2DP sink role on your Windows 10 PC. One such app is Bluetooth Audio Receiver, which you can download from the Microsoft Store for free. To install this app, follow these steps:

- On your Windows 10 PC, open Microsoft Store and search for Bluetooth Audio Receiver.
- Select the app from the search results and click Get to download and install it.
- Once the app is installed, open it from the Start menu or the Microsoft Store.

## Step 3: Connect your Bluetooth audio source device
 
The final step is to connect your Bluetooth audio source device to your Windows 10 PC using the Bluetooth Audio Receiver app. To do this, follow these steps:

- On your Windows 10 PC, open the Bluetooth Audio Receiver app.
- The app will list all the connected audio devices that support A2DP. Select your Bluetooth audio source device from the list and click Connect.
- You should see a message that says Connected when the connection is established.
- Now you can play music or any other audio from your Bluetooth audio source device and hear it on your Windows 10 PC.

Note: You can also adjust the volume and playback controls from the app or use keyboard shortcuts. To disconnect your Bluetooth audio source device, click Disconnect in the app or turn off Bluetooth on either device.
