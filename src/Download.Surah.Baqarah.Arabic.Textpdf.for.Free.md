## Benefits of Reading Surah Baqarah
 
Reading Surah Baqarah has many benefits for Muslims, both in this world and the hereafter. Some of the benefits are:
 
- Protection from Shaitan and evil: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "Do not make your houses as graveyards. Shaitan runs away from the house in which Surah Baqarah is recited." (Sahih Muslim) He also said, "Whoever recites the last two verses of Surah Al-Baqarah at night, they will suffice him." (Sahih Bukhari) These verses are a source of protection and security from all kinds of harm and mischief.
- Guidance and wisdom: Surah Baqarah contains many verses that guide us to the right path and teach us how to live according to Allah's will. It also contains stories of previous nations and prophets, such as Adam, Ibrahim, Musa, and Isa (peace be upon them), that teach us valuable lessons and morals. Surah Baqarah also contains Ayat ul-Kursi, which is the greatest verse of the Quran that describes Allah's attributes and power. The Prophet (ï·º) said, "Whoever recites Ayat ul-Kursi after every obligatory prayer, nothing will prevent him from entering Paradise except death." (Sunan Nasa'i)
- Blessing and reward: Surah Baqarah is a source of blessing and reward for those who recite it regularly and sincerely. The Prophet (ï·º) said, "Recite Surah Al-Baqarah, for to take recourse to it is a blessing and to give it up is a cause of grief, and the magicians cannot confront it." (Sahih Muslim) He also said, "Recite the Quran, for on the Day of Resurrection it will come as an intercessor for those who recite it. Recite the two bright ones, Al-Baqarah and Al-Imran, for on the Day of Resurrection they will come as two clouds or two shades or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them." (Sahih Muslim)
